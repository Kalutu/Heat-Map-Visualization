## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-temperature-visualization.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd global-temperature-visualization
3. Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

### Features
- Interactive visualization of global temperature data: Users can interact with the visualization by hovering over data points to view detailed information, such as the year, month, temperature, and variance.

- Different colors indicating temperature variance: The visualization uses different colors to represent temperature variances. Cooler temperatures are displayed in blue shades, while warmer temperatures are shown in orange and red shades.

- Tooltip displaying detailed information for each data point: When users hover over a data point, a tooltip appears, providing additional details about the temperature for that specific month and year.

- Scalable and responsive design: The visualization is designed to be scalable and responsive, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- D3.js (Data-Driven Documents)

## Data Source
